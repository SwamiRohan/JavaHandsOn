1. String is immutable means once assigned it cannot be modified. Any modification on a string object will
   lead to new object creation.

2. String values are stored in memory depends on how we create them.

3. Method 1: String literals : - String str = "rohan";
   In case of String literals every time compiler checks in string pool which is inside heap memory if found
   than it will be reused.

4. Method 2: Create String object using "new" keyword
   String str = new String("rohan");
   In this case every time new object will be created no String pool check will be performed it is also
   stored in heap memory.
